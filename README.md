## Project Overview

This repository contains the full pipeline and serving stack for Reedus, a personalized robot assistant built on top of a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). Reedus is designed to act as a friendly, forklift-armed mobile helper: capable of holding natural conversations, remembering small facts about the user, and carrying out task-driven behaviors in the physical world.

The project takes an open-source base model (Mistral-7B) and specializes it using a custom LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning process. The training emphasizes empathetic dialogue, small-talk fluency, and competence in practical tasks, so the assistant can serve both as a useful tool and as a source of companionship.

In addition, the system will integrate a purpose-built object detection model with intent loading, allowing Reedus to recognize and interact with physical objects based on user-provided keywords.

Overall, this stack will transform a general LLM into a robot-ready conversational brain that can integrate with onboard cameras, microphones, and control systems for real world operations.

## Educational Value Added

This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the end-to-end lifecycle of large language models. It directly engages with dataset acquisition, normalization, blending, and fine-tuning, while exploring advanced techniques such as LoRA parameter-efficient training and 4-bit quantization. This enhances understanding of the practical trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and deployment.

Beyond machine learning, the project bridges into robotics and human–AI interaction. Reedus is not just a conversational agent but an embodied assistant that connects language understanding to real-world actions. This encourages deeper thought about how dialogue can function as a control interface, emphasizing the importance of empathetic, approachable design in robotics. It demonstrates how emotional intelligence and memory systems can increase trust and usability in human–robot collaboration.

The repository also illustrates best practices in data engineering and systems integration. It involves balancing diverse conversational datasets, building robust validation pipelines, and deploying models through a user-facing interface. These practices mirror the real-world challenges of managing large, heterogeneous data sources and ensuring seamless integration into end-user applications.

Equally important is the emphasis on ethics and privacy. Reedus includes features such as controllable memory, reset options, and natural conversation rules designed to prevent overreach. This approach reflects a commitment to making technology not only powerful but also responsible, safe, and user-centered.

In summary, the project represents a unique fusion of advanced AI, robotics, and ethical design, creating a platform that pushes technical boundaries while keeping real-world impact and human-centered values at its core.
